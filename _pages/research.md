## Working Papers

**[Beating the Clock: Intensive Margin Responses to Year-End Tax Incentives]()**  
*[Job Market Paper - Draft Available Soon]*
<div style="text-align: justify"> <font size="3"> <b>Abstract:</b> Identifying the effect of taxes on the labor supply of people who would work regardless has been a longstanding empirical challenge. This paper proposes a new source of variation -- changes in projected year-end tax rates -- to measure households' intensive-margin labor supply elasticity. I extend the standard non-linear budget set approach to model multiple periods and uncertainty about future employment to predict how households will adjust labor supply throughout the tax year as a function of to-date earnings. I use survey and administrative data to measure how low-income households' earnings and employment vary within and across tax years and study how these households respond to changes in tax incentives. In contrast to most work studying employment responses to the Earned Income Tax Credit, I find a non-zero response to tax incentives among workers. My preferred estimates of intensive margin labor supply elasticity that ranges between .06 and .2, which are are similar to those estimated in an older literature which used non-linear budget set to estimate labor supply elasticities.</font> </div>

**[Can Nudges Increase Take-up of the Earned Income Tax Credit?: Evidence from Multiple Field Experiments](mattunrath.github.io/files/research/NudgesEITC.pdf)**  
*[Revise and Resubmit -- American Economic Journal: Economic Policy]*

<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) distributes more than $60 billion to over 20 million low-income families annually. Nevertheless, an estimated one-fifth of eligible households do not claim it. We ran six pre-registered, large-scale field experiments, involving over one million subjects, to test whether “nudges” could increase EITC take-up. Despite varying the content, design, messenger, and mode of our messages, we find no evidence that they affected households’ likelihood of filing a tax return or claiming the credit. We conclude that even the most behaviorally informed low-touch outreach efforts cannot overcome the barriers faced by low-income households who do not file returns.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> We use traditional and non-traditional data to measure the collapse and partial recovery of the U.S. labor market from March to early July, contrast this downturn to previous recessions, and provide preliminary evidence on the effects of the policy response. For hourly workers at both small and large businesses, nearly all of the decline in employment occurred between March 14 and 28. It was driven by low-wage services, particularly the retail and leisure and hospitality sectors. A large share of the job losses in small businesses reflected firms that closed entirely, though many subsequently reopened. Firms that were already unhealthy were more likely to close and less likely to reopen, and disadvantaged workers were more likely to be laid off and less likely to return. Most laid off workers expected to be recalled, and this was predictive of rehiring. Shelter-in-place orders drove only a small share of job losses. Last, states that received more small business loans from the Paycheck Protection Program and states with more generous unemployment insurance benefits had milder declines and faster recoveries. We find no evidence that high UI replacement rates drove job losses or slowed rehiring.</div>

**[Retention, Screening and Retention: Evidence from California's Food Stamps Program]()**  
<div style="text-align: justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> Many households eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) do not enroll. Using a new dataset of monthly enrollment histories for all SNAP participants in California between 2005 and 2020, this paper documents how procedures required to verify eligibility lower retention and contribute to incomplete take-up. Whether this non-participation is optimal depends on whether these hassles most deter enrollment among more advantaged prospective applicants. I find that the vast majority of households who exit SNAP are income eligible in the months before and after their exit. At the same time,  no longer eligible households, those with higher earnings and those less likely to be food insecure are more likely to exit. My findings underscore the policy tradeoff inherent to administering means-tested programs.</div>
