I am an Assistant Professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California. Previously, I served as an economist at the US Census Bureau. I received a PhD in Public Policy from UC Berkeley, and I remain an affiliate of the California Policy Lab.

My research focuses on how individuals interact with tax and transfer policies. I study why households do not take up assistance for which they're eligible and whether these programs affect how much individuals work. With Census colleagues, I also research how to improve income and poverty measurement using linked survey and administrative data.
