I am a PhD candidate at the Goldman School of Public Policy and a Research Fellow at the [California Policy Lab](www.capolicylab.com) at UC Berkeley.

My research focuses on households' interactions with transfer policies and means-tested programs. I study why some individuals fail to take-up assistance for which they're eligible and whether these programs affect how much individuals choose to work.

My research has been funded by the UC Berkeley Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty, the Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy, and the UC Berkeley Opportunity Lab.
